# Political Funds & Affairs Transparency

Team Workflow:
1.  Create different branches that focus on specific areas of the project. For instance for the HTML, we created a midright 
and mid_left_box branch that allowed us to divide the work of the required HTML elements. In addition, for implementing the responsive 
design and accessibility feature, responsive and accessibility branches were created to work on implementing those specific functionalities. 
2. Once the feature is complete, merge branch with main and push to remote repository
